	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	  Use background threads to compress IO data to leverage multiple
	  CPU power so that it can increase write throughput.
	  To enable the feature, echo 1 > /sys/block/zramX/async before
	  the setting disksize.
